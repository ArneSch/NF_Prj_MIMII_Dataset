## machine activation
- if a machine is not permanent active this needs to be known to the algorithem... else false abnormal detection in inactivty might be detected

## calibration phase
- TODO explaint the possibel ways to make the machine learn normal and total time needed etc.

## what is abnormal in a spectrum or in time
- after detecting a abnormal what feature is made the algorthem thing it is abnormal is vital for debugging and post missclassifaction training

## if multilabel use
- if more cluster are found by unsupervised methodes the match to the cluster spectrum can be recorded and used to record how often a similer event is occuring this can be insight for machine monitoring and defining what modes are correlatble with other machine modes or what is worth investigating is not expalinabel etc.
