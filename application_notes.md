## machine activation
- if a machine is not permanent active this needs to be known to the algorithem... else false abnormal detection in inactivty might be detected

## calibration phase
- TODO explaint the possibel ways to make the machine learn normal and total time needed etc.

## what is abnormal in a spectrum or in time
- after detecting a abnormal what feature is made the algorthem thing it is abnormal is vital for debugging and post missclassifaction training
